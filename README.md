# NaiveBayesClassifier_OrangesVsGrapefruits
The objective of this project was to employ a Na√Øve Bayes Classifier (NBC) to classify oranges and grapefruits, relying on five key features: diameter, weight, and three distinct colors. The study leveraged the Scikit-learn, pandas, and NumPy libraries to analyze a comprehensive dataset comprising 10,000 data instances. Impressively, the model demonstrated its proficiency by achieving a remarkable 92% accuracy on both the train and test datasets.
